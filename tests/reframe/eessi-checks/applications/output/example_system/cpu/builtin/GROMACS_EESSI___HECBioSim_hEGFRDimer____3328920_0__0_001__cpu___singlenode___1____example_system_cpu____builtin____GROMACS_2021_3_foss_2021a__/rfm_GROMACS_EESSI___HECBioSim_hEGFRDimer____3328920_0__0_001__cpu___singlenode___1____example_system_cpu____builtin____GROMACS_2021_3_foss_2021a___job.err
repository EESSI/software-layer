Reading file benchmark.tpr, VERSION 5.1.4 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 103, software tpx version 122
Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 1.2 to 1.307

Using 128 MPI processes

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process

starting mdrun 'Her1-Her1'
10000 steps,     20.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was turned on during the run due to measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 4.7%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 86%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 4.0%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Y 0 % Z 0 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.692
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 6.8 %

NOTE: 6.8 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had less work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to decrease the number of PME ranks
      or decrease the cut-off and the grid spacing.
