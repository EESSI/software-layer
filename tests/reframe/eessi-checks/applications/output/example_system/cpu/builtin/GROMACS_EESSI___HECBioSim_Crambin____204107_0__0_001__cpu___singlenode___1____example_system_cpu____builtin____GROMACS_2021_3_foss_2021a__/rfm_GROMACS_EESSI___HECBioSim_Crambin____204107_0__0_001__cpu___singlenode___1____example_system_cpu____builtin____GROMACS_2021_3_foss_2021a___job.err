Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was turned on during the run due to measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 9.8%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 80%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 7.8%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Y 0 % Z 0 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.619
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 8.2 %

NOTE: 7.8 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You can consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.
NOTE: 8.2 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had less work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to decrease the number of PME ranks
      or decrease the cut-off and the grid spacing.
