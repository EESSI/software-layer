Reading file benchmark.tpr, VERSION 5.1.4 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 103, software tpx version 122
Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 1.2 to 1.307

Using 72 MPI processes

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process

starting mdrun 'Her1-Her1'
10000 steps,     20.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 16.4%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 53%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 8.6%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.817
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 3.0 %

NOTE: 8.6 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      Dynamic load balancing was automatically disabled, but it might be beneficial to manually tuning it on (option -dlb on.)
      You can also consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.

GROMACS reminds you: "The physical chemists never use their eyes and are most lamentably lacking in chemical culture. It is essential to cast out from our midst, root and branch, this physical element and return to our laboratories." (Henry Edward Armstrong)
