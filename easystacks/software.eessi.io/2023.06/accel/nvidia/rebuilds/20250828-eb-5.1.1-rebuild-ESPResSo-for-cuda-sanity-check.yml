# We'll rebuild all CUDA software, for various reasons
# 1. We now have a proper CUDA sanity check, and if anything was 'wrong' with our current CUDA installs, we'd like
# to know about it
# 2. The PR implementing a CI to check for differences between officially supported CUDA Compute Capabilities shows
# that there are a lot of missing installations https://github.com/EESSI/software-layer/pull/1087 . A rebuild PR like
# this will have the convenient side effect of filling all those holes
