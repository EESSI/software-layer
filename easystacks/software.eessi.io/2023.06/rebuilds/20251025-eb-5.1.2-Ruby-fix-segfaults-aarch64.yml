# 2025.10.25
# Some Ruby 3.2.2/3.3.0 installations (built on JURECA which has not enabled
# PAC+BTI CPU features) segfault on some NVIDIA Grace systems (SURF-ETP, Olivia,
# eX3) which have PAC+BTI CPU features enabled.
# 
# See https://gitlab.com/eessi/support/-/issues/197 for details.
#
# Both versions are rebuilt for NVIDIA Grace (maybe more ARM architectures?)
# ensuring that PAC+BTI CPU features are handled correctly.
