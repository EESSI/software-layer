# For A64FX an SVE patch had to be added to all GROMACS 2024.x easyconfigs:
# https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/24548
# And another one to solve a double-precision SVE bug:
# https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/24602
# The latter patch also fixes issues for Neoverse V1 and NVIDIA Grace.
# In order to keep things consistent across all CPU targets,
# we rebuild all existing 2024.x versions with the same 
# EasyBuild version + easyblock + easyconfig.
