# While adding support for Intel Sapphire Rapids, additional patches applied to the
# original easyconfig were required to successfully build SciPy-bundle 2023.07.
# In order to keep the stack consistent across the different CPUs,
# a rebuild is done for all CPU targets with this updated easyconfig.
# See:
