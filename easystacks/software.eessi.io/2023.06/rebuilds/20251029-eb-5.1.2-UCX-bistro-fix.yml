# With an update to CUDA driver R575 or newer UCX fails to create a registration cache
# This cache is essential to prevent having to pin memory for every individual data
# transfer. Pinning memory for every individual transfer introduces a high overhead on
# every transfer, crippling performance
# A patch was introduced to solve the issue, this rebuild reinstalls UCX with that patch.
