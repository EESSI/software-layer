# GObject-Introspection sets $LD_LIBRARY_PATH (to many different paths, including $EPREFIX/lib)
# when calling gcc, and this causes a lot of issues for, especially, scripts using /bin/bash.
#
# This rebuild ensures (by using a new EasyBuild hook) that GObject-Introspection will not set
# environment variables that are configured to be filtered by EasyBuild.
# 
# See https://github.com/EESSI/software-layer/issues/196
