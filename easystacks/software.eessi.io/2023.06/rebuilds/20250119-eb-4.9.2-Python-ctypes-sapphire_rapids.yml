# Python ctypes relies on LD_LIBRARY_PATH and doesn't respect rpath linking. There is a workaround
# for the EasyBuild context in https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/3352.
#
# This rebuild ensures this fix is available for all Python versions shipped with EESSI.
# 
# See https://gitlab.com/eessi/support/-/issues/77
