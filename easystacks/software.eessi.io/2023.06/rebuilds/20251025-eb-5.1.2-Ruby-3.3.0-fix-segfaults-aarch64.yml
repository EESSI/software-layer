# Some Ruby 3.3.0 installations for NVIDIA Grace (built on JURECA which has not
# enabled PAC+BTI CPU features) and for Neoverse V1 (built on AWS) segfault on
# some NVIDIA Grace systems (SURF-ETP, Olivia, eX3) which have PAC+BTI CPU
# features enabled.
# 
# See https://gitlab.com/eessi/support/-/issues/197 for details.
#
# Also version 3.2.2 had the same problem, but is being rebuilt in a separate PR
# because for 'zen4' there is only a dummy module (for all modules based on
# foss/2022b)
