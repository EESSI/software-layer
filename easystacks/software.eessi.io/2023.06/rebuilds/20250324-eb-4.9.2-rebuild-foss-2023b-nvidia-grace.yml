# A more recent version of easyconfig for GCCcore-13.2.0.eb 'leaked' into the build
# by PR https://github.com/EESSI/software-layer/pull/977 due to the use of
# 'from-pr'
#
# We aim to circumvent that issue by using EB 4.9.2 (instead of EB 4.9.0), but then
# have to use from-commit and include-easyblocks-from-commit even if they haven't
# been used for the original build (with EB 4.9.0)
#
# In general, we do the following
# - if no 'include-easyblocks-from-pr' was used, add
#   'include-easyblocks-from-commit: 5106dfadc10982c05abc782770478e1685090481'
#   SHA corresponds to release of EB 4.9.0 in easyblocks repository
# - if 'include-easyblocks-from-pr' was used, use the most recent commit of that PR
# - if no 'from-pr' was used, add 'from-commit: bdcc586189fcb3e5a340cddebb50d0e188c63cdc'
#   SHA corresponds to release of EB 4.9.0 in easyconfigs repository
# - if 'from-pr' was used, use the most recent commit of that PR
