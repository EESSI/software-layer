# Python ctypes relies on LD_LIBRARY_PATH and doesn't respect rpath linking. A prior workaround
# was implemented in EasyBuild in https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/3352.
# However, while this fixed ctypes.util.find_library(), a similar issue popped up in ctypes.CLL
# and ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary https://gitlab.com/eessi/support/-/issues/154
# An easyblock change and patch were implemented for Python.
#
# This rebuild ensures this fix is available for all Python versions based on 12.2.0
# i.e. this rebuild is done for every architecture _except_ zen4, where this toolchain isn't supported
