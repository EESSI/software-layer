# 2025.10.09
# Rebuild Perl-bundle-CPAN 5.36.1 to synchronise the extensions between archs.
# This is necessary because the A64FX version was built with a newer EB version,
# and the list of extensions had changed.
# Rebuilding for A64FX version didn't work because of a known and solved issue
# regarding the tests of an extension, so this rebuilds it for the other targets instead.
