# 2025.10.08
# 
# The openCARP 17.0 installation for A64FX was built with ParMETIS support (because it had an outdated EESSI-extend at the time of building),
# while it was disabled for the other targets.
# This rebuild will make sure that openCARP and its dependencies PETSc and SuperLU_DIST  get built without ParMETIS support,
# and will allow us to remove ParMETIS from the A64FX stack.
