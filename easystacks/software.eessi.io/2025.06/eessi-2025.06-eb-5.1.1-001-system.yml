  # note: M4 is only listed here because it's a build dependency for GCCcore,
  #       but it was still filtered out as dependency when GCCcore/13.3.0 and GCCcore/14.2.0 got built;
  #       now Autotools/Automake/libtool/M4 are retained as (build) dependency because the newer versions
  #       in EESSI 2025.06 compat layer can cause problems with some installations (like OpenMPI);
  #       see also https://github.com/EESSI/software-layer-scripts/pull/74
