# The --with-sysroot flag for UCX was causing weird issues with
# library paths in .la files being prefixed with a = sign, e.g. "=/cvmfs/.....".
# The option was removed from our hooks, see:
# https://github.com/EESSI/software-layer-scripts/pull/133
# Due to this, all UCX versions have to be rebuilt.
